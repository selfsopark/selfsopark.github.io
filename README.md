Welcome to my website!

I am Professor of Korean Philosophy at Sungkyunkwan University and director of Institute of Korean Philosophy and Culture ([IKPC](https://swb.skku.edu/korphil/Eng.do)), where I lead the K-Academic Expansion Project ([KAEP](https://swb.skku.edu/kphilo_eng/index.do)). My research interests encompass Korean Philosophy, Comparative Philosophy, and the Philosophy of Music. I have published widely in Korean, English, and Chinese, including “[A Study on Seongho Yi Ik’s Emotional Spectrum ― Focusing on the Analysis of Emotional Vocabulary through Word2Vec](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART003068674))” (Korean, 2024, collab.), “The Dynamic Characteristics of “Jeong 情”: A New Perspective on the Korean Neo-Confucian Four–Seven Debate (2023)”, “[On Sound: Reconstructing a Zhuangzian Perspective of Music](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/5/1/3))” (English, 2015), 《流动的音乐思维——先秦诸子音乐论新探》(Chinese, 2016)

I have also developed online courses available on Coursera, such as "Introduction to Korean Philosophy and Culture", which has drawn over 17K learners, "In Search for the Origins of Korean Philosophy", "Exploration to Korean Philosophy 1 - Modernity and the Emergence of Korean Philosophy", "Exploration to Korean Philosophy 2 - Formation of Korean Neo-Confucianism", and "Korean Music, A Philosophical Exploration (collab.)".
