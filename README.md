Welcome to my website!

I am Professor of Korean Philosophy at Sungkyunkwan University and director of Institute of Korean Philosophy and Culture ([IKPC](https://swb.skku.edu/korphil/Eng.do)), where I lead the K-Academic Expansion Project ([KAEP](https://swb.skku.edu/kphilo_eng/index.do)). My research interests encompass Korean Philosophy, Comparative Philosophy, and the Philosophy of Music. I have published widely in Korean, English, and Chinese, including “[A Study on Seongho Yi Ik’s Emotional Spectrum ― Focusing on the Analysis of Emotional Vocabulary through Word2Vec](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART003068674)” (Korean, 2024, collab.), “[The Dynamic Characteristics of “Jeong 情”: A New Perspective on the Korean Neo-Confucian Four–Seven Debate](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/5/663)" (2023), “[On Sound: Reconstructing a Zhuangzian Perspective of Music](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/5/1/3)” (English, 2015), 《[流动的音乐思维——先秦诸子音乐论新探](https://www.bookschina.com/7119410.htm)》(Chinese, 2016)

I have also developed online courses available on Coursera, such as "[Introduction to Korean Philosophy and Culture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-korean-philosophy-and-culture)", which has drawn over 17K learners, "[In Search for the Origins of Korean Philosophy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/in-search-for-the-origins-of-korean-philosophy)", "[Exploration to Korean Philosophy 1 - Modernity and the Emergence of Korean Philosophy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploration-to-korean-philosophy-1)", "[Exploration to Korean Philosophy 2 - Formation of Korean Neo-Confucianism](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploration-to-korean-philosophy-2)", and "[Korean Music, A Philosophical Exploration](https://www.coursera.org/learn/korean-music-a-philosophical-exploration) (collab.)".
